Machine Learning to Predict Stock Prices
As financial institutions begin to embrace artificial intelligence, machine learning is increasingly utilized to help make trading decisions. Although there is an abundance of stock data for machine learning models to train on, a high noise to signal ratio and the multitude of factors that affect stock prices are among the several reasons that predicting the market difficult. At the same time, these models don’t need to reach high levels of accuracy because even 60% accuracy can deliver solid returns. One method for predicting stock prices is using a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) for times series forecasting.

LSTMs are an improved version of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are analogous to human learning. When humans think, we don’t start our thinking from scratch each second. For example, in the sentence “Bob plays basketball”, we know that Bob is the person who plays basketball because we retain information about past words while reading sentences. Similarly, RNNs are networks with loops in them, which allow them to use past information before arriving at a final output. However, RNNs can only connect recent previous information and cannot connect information as the time gap grows. This is where LSTMs come into play; LSTMs are a type of RNN that remember information over long periods of time, making them better suited for predicting stock prices.
